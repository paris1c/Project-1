We have use Our World in Data Covid dataset for the purpose of this project. Our World in Data is a scientific online publication which focuses on large global problems such as disease, climate change, war, etc. This dataset is consist of 207 countries.

## Research questions to answer:
1. Correlation between cases and amount of people vaccinated - Parisa
2. GDP versus vaccines/cases - parisa
4. Trend of Covid related total deaths by country  -vasanta
5. Progress of fully vaccinated people in the world by country - vasanta
6. How effective the vaccination is in each country - Laurane
7. New cases over time by country - Victoria 
8. Hospitalization rate by country - Victoria
9. If people with preexisting conditions are more prone to be hospitalized or die -Laurane
