## Team Members:

## Introduction:
A novel corona virus (COVID 19) was identified in 2019 in Wuhan China. It has spread rapidly worldwide and was officially declared to be a pandemic by the WHO. To better understand the data available about it, we will be doing exploratory data analysis of the available COVID 19 data.  The goal of the project is to study the impact of COVID 19 across the world using Python, Pandas, Plotly express and Matplotlib and present visualizations to show our analysis.

## Dataset:
### Our World In Data - COVID 19 data, Vaccination data and Hospitalization data
We have use Our World in Data Covid dataset for the purpose of this project. Our World in Data is a scientific online publication which focuses on large global problems such as disease, climate change, war, etc. This dataset is consist of 207 countries.

## Project proposal and questions to analyze:
1. Global impact of Covid 19 by Income Groups - Parisa
2. If people with pre-existing conditions are more prone to be hospitalized or die -Laurane 
3. Top 10 Countries by Cases - Victoria
4. Top 10 Counties by Hospitalization/ICU Admissions - Victoria
5. Trend of Covid related total deaths by country  -Vasanta
6. Progress of fully vaccinated people in the world by country - Vasanta

##  Analysis and conclusions
1. A glance at the vaccination plot reveals a clear pattern that, rich countries are vaccinated but poor countries are not! We also notice that Rich countries had access to vaccine lots earlier compared to Poor countries. 

By looking at number of cases Plot, we notice that we notice a sharp increase in number of cases in Rich Countries right before the 2022 New Year, which suggests that people were getting infected when they were not practicing social distancing during the Holidays.
On the other hand, when we look at Cases Plot for Poor countries, we notice that those countries don't have many cases. The reason is not that they have lower cases, the reason could be that those countries have limited access to test kits and also their healthcare providers don't have all the necessary resources to record and report the number of cases accurately.

At last, by studying the number of deaths we notice that number of deaths are lower in Rich countries compared to low income countries which is related to not having access to vaccination and having limitation in hospitalization and medication.
